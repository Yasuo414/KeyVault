# Questions
You: what is "KeyVault"?
Me: "KeyVault" is a password manager that generates passwords and then encrypts them.
    It's like Microsoft Authenticator, but better.

You: where are the passwords stored or how to view them?
Me: The passwords are stored in the administrator and after the first use you set a master password that protects the others.
    After you log in, you can use the search engine to view the passwords.
